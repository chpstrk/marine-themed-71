                            Project BOB aimed to install and commission an onboard oil blending system that enabled vessels to produce their own cylinder lubrication oil by blending system oil with additives. This initiative was designed to reduce operational costs, minimize waste, and enhance engine performance. I played a key role in overseeing the installation, commissioning, and validation of the BOB system while ensuring its seamless integration with vessel operations.
